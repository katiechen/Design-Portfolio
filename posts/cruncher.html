			<h2>Cruncher</h2>
			<p class="subheader">Branding and responsive web design for AI news platform Cruncher.</p>

			<div id="laughlybanner" class="banner"></div><br>

			<h3>Project Intro</h3>
			<p>Cruncher is a platform that uses AI to consume articles from as many sources as possible to generate the most neutral, unbiased summary of a certain topic. It aims to provide readers with a neutral point of view, as well as opposing sides, to provide the most comprehensive and trustworthy information about a certain news topic.<br> The Cruncher team approached us to help <b>1) define their visual brand</b> and <b>2) design the responsive web interface.</b><br> I worked with a team of 5 other designers and had ownership over <b>the visual branding and interaction design process</b>.</p>

			<h3>The Process</h3>
			<p>The client provided us with adjectives they thought the visual brand should embody. We used these as our guiding design principles in studying competitors and in branding and interaction explorations. These were: <b>Solid, Trustworthy, Clean, Neutral,</b> and <b>Authoritative</b>.

			<h4>USER RESEARCH</h4>
			<p>To guide our design process even further, we started off by interviewing the client's target users, young intellectual professionals who were somehow engaged in news and the media. We asked questions surrounding their news reading habits, what types of stories they intentionally sought out to read, and what they thought was missing from today's news sources.

			<h4>COMPETITOR RESEARCH</h4>
			<p>We also took a look at news sources the client named as being very trustworthy and authoritative. We took inspiration in branding colors, layout, and font styles.</p>

			<h3>Interactions</h3>
			<p>We were challenged to explore innovative interactions that would <b>allow users to intuitively realize that they are able to read multiple sides to a single story on the platform</b>. We recognized that this was a new concept to most people through our user interviews. We were also visually and technically constrained by designing for responsive web, and not for a native mobile app.</p>

			<h4>INTERACTION EXPLORATION AND IDEATION</h4>
			<p>We struggled coming up with solutions that didn't directly label a certain side of the story. Not all stories would have a conservative/liberal point of view or a negative/positive sentiment. We also tried to stay away from colors to prevent associations, such as red and blue (Republican vs. Democrat) or red and green (Bad vs. Good). [IDEATION SKETCHING PICTURES]</p>
 
			<p>We erred on the side of staying as neutral as possible, knowing that there would be many learned interactions, since this was a new concept. We decided to have <b>semi-transparent sides peeking in on the main, neutral story</b> to hint that they can be interacted with, without being intrusive and distracting while reading. [ARTICLE PAGE SCREENSHOT]<br> I tackled exploring how to introduce the concept of multiple sides of the story elsewhere on the platform, in places even before the reader arrives at an article page. My decision was to have the <b>opposing headlines slide in when hovered over a story on the home page</b>. [GIF OF HOVER AND SCROLL INTERACTIONS]</p>

			<h3>Visual Branding</h3>
			<h4>BRANDING WORKSHOP</h4>
			<p>We decided to delve further into what vision the client had for the platform's brand by conducting <a href="https://www.cooper.com/journal/2015/3/the-experience-workshop-a-cooper-primer">Cooper's Brand Experience Workshop</a> with them. [PICTURE OF BRANDING WORKSHOP]</p>

			<p>We generated a word cloud from our insights and uncovered important indicators. For example, the client wanted to convey authority, but not come off as elitist.</p>

			<h4>LOGO AND COLOR EXPLORATION</h4>
			<p>As a team, we explored logos that alluded to the multiple-sides-of-the-story concept. The client requested a color for the brand that would try to remain trustworthy and neutral, yet also incite a reaction in readers. [PICTURE OF LOGO AND COLOR EXPLORATION]</p>

			<p>After presenting all of our options to the client, we chose the following logo with the color teal. We took concepts from color psychology that stated that teal conveyed <b>communication, trustworthiness, reliability, and clarity of thought.</b> Teal is also not a commonly used color, which we thought could set the Cruncher brand aside from other news platforms.</p>

			<h4>FONT EXPLORATION</h4>
			<p>We studied fonts that were highly legible and aligned with the brand principles. [PICTURE OF FONT EXPLORATION]<br>
			We landed on Charter for the headline typeface and Franklin Gothic for the body.</p>
