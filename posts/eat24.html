			<h2>Eat24 Usability Test and Redesign</h2>

			<h3>Project Intro</h3>
			<p>Amidst the increasing number of food delivery apps, I decided to critique Yelp's Eat24 mobile app. Just by word of mouth within my network, more people who use food delivery apps seem to use competing services Postmates and GrubHub. Even through a simple Google search of "food delivery apps," I see that Eat24 comes in after additional competitors DoorDash and Munchery. <br>
			I want to discover insights into why this is, despite Yelp's popular review service and strong user base. I hope to use these insights to create redesigns that will leverage Yelp's strengths to create a better experience for Eat24 users.</p>

			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>Through analysis of research drawn from usability testing and user interviews, detailed in the rest of this case study, I've identified and decided to focus on the following pain points experienced by users of the Eat24 app: <br></p>

			<p class="numer"><b>1) Users are confused about how search results are ordered and ranked. <br>
			 2) Users would like to easily see reviews before choosing and placing their order. <br>
			 3) Users expect a readily available tracking indication of their order.</b></p>

			<h3>User Research</h3>
			<p>On an, aptly, rainy day, I approached strangers to run usability tests on the Eat24 app. Using a GoPro to record their voice, their fingers, and the screen, I interviewed 7 people and later compiled the insights drawn from their interactions with the app. I had users: <br> 
			<p class="numer"><b>1) Imagine a situation in which they would usually rather order delivery to order a food of their choice using the Eat24 app <br>
			2) Express their general thoughts on the app's key screens (search and restaurant menu)</b></p><br>
			<p>The users I interviewed were 20-30 years old (one user in his 40s). Most of them didn't use food delivery apps, but have ordered delivery. 3 users have used services Postmates and GrubHub. <br>
		    I later created an <b>affinity map</b>, placing each separate insight into different categories. I also created a <b>2x2 diagram in which the x-axis is labeled "Least to Most Important to Users" and the y-axis is labled "Least to Most Important to Business"</b>. Making informed guesses about Yelp's business goals, I found that most insights</p>

		    <p>To organize my findings and help me better understand the users as a whole, I created a <b>persona that represents the users I interviewed</b>.</p>

		    <p>I illustrated <b>scenarios</b> that my persona might go through, based on the situations the users I interviewed described that they would usually order delivery. I used these to better understand </p>

		    <h3>Synthesis and Analysis</h3>
		    <p>All users had no trouble searching and successfully placing an order for their desired food. Most users, however, expressed some sort of confusion at some point along the process. <br>
		    2 users knew exactly the restaurant they wanted to order from and directly navigated there to place an order. All other users spent time browsing their options. A majority of users questioned the ranking system of the options presented to them. They were confused why lower rated, and farther, restaurants were shown first. One was even frustrated that he was shown 3 different 3-starred restaurants before being shown a 4-star. This led me to focus on my first pain point: <b>1) Users are confused about how search results are ordered and ranked.</b><br>
		    All users, except one who specifically said he doesn't care about reviews, were influenced by the rating of the restaurant in making their choice. Most of them expressed that they were used to Yelp's main app and expected to easily look at reviews along with the restaurant rating. Thus, I decided to focus on a second pain point: <b>2) Users would like to easily see reviews before choosing and placing their order.</b><br>
			All users were able to easily find the "Order Status" feature in the app and knew exactly how to use it. A majority of users, however, were surprised to see a chat room or a "real" person responding back to them. While none of them were upset that they had to go through someone else to check on the status of their order, many of them expressed that they would've liked to see a UPS-esque tracker of some sort. So, my third pain point is <b>3) Users expect a readily tracking indication of their order.</b></p>
