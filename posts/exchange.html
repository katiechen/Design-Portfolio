			<h2>Exchange</h2>

			<div id="exchangebanner" class="banner"></div>

			<h3>Project Intro</h3>
			<p>Exchange is a project that I designed to help international students acclimate to student lifestyle at a Japanese university by connecting with local students through a forum.</p>

			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>While studying abroad in Tokyo, I shared struggles of being a student in a new country with my peers.<br>
			There exist online resources for foreigners living in Japan. While many of them cater towards budgeted living and short-term stay, none seem to be specifically for students.</p>

			<h3>User Research</h3>
			<p>I surveyed my fellow study abroad students and asked them what struggles they had and how an app would have helped that process. I also proposed a follow-up question asking how a mobile app specifically for students would function differently than existing foreigner resources.<br>
			The most notable idea was that this app would be unique if it provided a way for international students to get help from local Japanese students who had the most relevant experiences and advice.</p>

			<h3>The Process</h3>
			<p>I wrestled with the problem that putting all the suggested functions in one app would be too much and the app, although would provide convenient information, would not be convenient to navigate and use.</p>

			<div class="filler"></div>

			<p>I then decided to focus on what a majority of the ideas proposed would be most helpful. I reasoned that a forum would allow international students to directly get the most relevant information and resources through talking directly with local Japanese students.</p>

			<div class="filler"></div>

			<p>I brought the mock-ups below to test with my study abroad friends. They immediately pointed out that “Recent” posts and “Unanswered” posts would overlap in that recent posts would clearly be unanswered.<br> I had chosen to include an “Unanswered” filter so that Japanese students would be able to find posts that still needed help. I decided to change this to “Inactive”, to filter posts that have been unanswered for a longer period of time.</p>

			<h3>The Solution</h3>
			<p>Below are my final designs.<br> I looked to different forum sites, such as Quora and Stack Overflow, to observe how users posted and interacted with posts. I included tags to allow users to quickly scan for relevant posts and to help will navigation through posts. I also included functions to star replies that are helpful and bookmark posts to follow replies. I used large, filled-in buttons to put emphasis on the call-to-actions, like replying.</p>

			<h3>Thoughts for the Future</h3>
			<p>This app was designed mainly in the perspective of the foreign exchange student who would be asking the questions. I would love to interview and test with more local students, the ones who would do the "answering", to see how they interacted with posts and other users.</p>
